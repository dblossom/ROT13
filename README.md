# ROT13
Simple ROT13 implemented in C.

A simple implementation of the ROT-13 to get my feet wet with learning C before attempting something larger.

This is being developed with Arch Linux.

From command line run ./rot13

Depending on what you pass, it will either be the encrypted or decrypted value, IE: ABC = NOP or NOP = ABC.
